# Salon-Management-and-Booking-Application-
A Database System designed in SQL for a Salon Management and Service Booking Application.

The aim is to automate and optimize the operational flow of salons — 
from customer booking to service delivery and performance analysis 
— using a normalized, relational database structure that ensures 
consistency, scalability, and integrity of data. 

The system supports two types of users — owners and customers. It 
enables streamlined booking and easy service delivery for the 
customers and also facilitates the owners of the salons with easy and 
efficient  staff management , continuous and accurate payment and 
feedback tracking. 

Using the concepts of Database Management System this is an attempt 
to build Database to implement the concepts into a real world problem. 
There can be a lot advancements that can be made to apply it to big 
data, but the current one focuses on the implementation of primary and 
small scale data manipulations using commonly used SQL commands.
